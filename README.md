# Deployment
this repository is used to deploy model

A complete data science process was carried out on the Citrone dataset.

The dataset was appropriately cleaned. Some of the columns were dropped to make the analysis quick and concise. Various statistical summaries like histogram plots, correlation plots, and scatter plots were plotted to show the relationship between different columns and make the data fit for machine learning models.

Machine learning models were trained with 80% of the data and tested on 20% of the data. The models performed well with more than 90% accuracy on the test dataset. The model was evaluated and deployed to evaluate its performance.
